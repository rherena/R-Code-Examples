## R Markdown Text and Code Chunks

This is an R Markdown document. My first R MarkDown! 

```{r cars, include=TRUE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
